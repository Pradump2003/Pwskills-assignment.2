    <h1> Web Design </h1>
    <p> Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan <br> 
        for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. <br>
        User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements <br> 
        presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves <br> 
        working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website <br> 
        is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks <br>
        visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is 
        designed.</p>
